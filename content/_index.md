I am a yellow sponge in [an imaginary world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants).

## About me

Sponges, the members of the phylum Porifera, are a basal Metazoa (animal) clade as a sister of the Diploblasts. They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. The branch of zoology that studies sponges is known as spongiology. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge))
